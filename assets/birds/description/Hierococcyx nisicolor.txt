霍氏鷹鵑
Hodgson's Hawk-cuckoo
Hierococcyx nisicolor
無危。春侯鳥及夏侯鳥。比鷹鵑小，下體沒有橫紋，偏好林區。鳴聲：很尖的"fee-weet"重覆多次，愈叫愈興奮，整夜鳴叫。
Least Concern. Spring and summer visitor. Smaller than Large Hawk Cuckoo and underparts unbarred. Favours wooded areas. Voice: Very shrill 'fee-weet' repeated many times and becoming frantic- calls at night.
