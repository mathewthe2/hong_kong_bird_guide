Cicadidae
春夏季會在樹幹上吸啜汁液和鳴叫。雄性成蟲腹部有發聲器，以鳴叫去吸引異性。雌性成蟲交配後在樹皮裂縫中產卵，幼蟲孵化後會鑽入泥土內，直至羽化。
Feed on sap and actively call on branches in spring and summer. Male adults call with the abdominal tybal to attract female. Female adults lay eggs in cracks of tree bark after mating. Nymphs grow underground after hatching until emergence.
