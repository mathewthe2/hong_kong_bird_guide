無危。留鳥。尾部非常短，頭部有淡色眼圈，嘴尖而短小，腳粉紅色。上體深褐色，下身深褐色，羽緣較白和粗，看似魚鱗紋。愛躲在溪澗附近的陰暗樹叢間中活動和鳴叫.
Least Concern. Common Residents. Very short tail. Pale eye-ring. Short and pointed bill, pink legs. Upperparts dark brown, _x005F_x0008_underparts dark brown, with thick whitish feather fringes which make it look like patterns of fish scale. Hides and calls in dense shrubs near hillstreams.
