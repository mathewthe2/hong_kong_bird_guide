林夜鷹
Savanna Nightjar
Caprimulgus affinis
無危。留鳥。與普通夜鷹比較，尾部較短。雄鳥尾羽外側白色，飛行時初級飛羽有一片白斑。雌鳥毛色偏褐，翼斑較淡。叫聲為響亮的「chweep」，好像將塑膠在玻璃上摩擦的聲音。見於開闊生態環境。
Least Concern. Resident. Short-tailed compared to Grey Nightjar. Male has white outer tail feathers and white wing patches especially visible in flight. Female has brown tail and duller wing patches. Call is a “chweep”, like the sound of plastic rubbed against glass. Found in open habitats.
